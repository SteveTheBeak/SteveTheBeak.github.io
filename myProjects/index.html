                        I began learning coding with Python, which I used to make a bunch of little 
                        games. One of the games is an astrology quiz game, which I used as a science project.

                        After learning the basics of the java programming language in grade 11, 
                        the final project in the course was to create a game using everything that we learned. 
                        I chose to make a recreation of flappy bird with a 2-player feature.

                            My first high school computer science class was all about learning the basics of 
                            <span class="highlight">coding</span>, <span class="highlight">logic</span>, and <span class="highlight">graphics</span> 
                            through <strong>Java</strong>. At the end of the course, each student 
                            created their own game using what we had learned in class. 
                            <br><br>
                            When the game is launched, the user is met with a title screen that gives 3 options — 
                            play the game with one or two players or read the rules. The single-player option works 
                            exactly like the original popular Flappy bird game, where the player uses a key to fly a bird through 
                            pipes as long as possible, including the score and even <em>sound effects</em>. <br>
                            The multi-player is a twist on the game, where two people could play simultaneously and the player 
                            who lasts the longest is the winner.

                        Throughout my Mechatronics and Robotics Design 1 course, we were 
                        tasked with programming a mini-bot to perform certain tasks. For example, 
                        it needed to be able to follow a line or pick up / drop items 
                        from one location to another.

                        <p class="box-description">
                            This project spanned 6 weeks, during which each group learned and practiced coding bots 
                            using <strong>Arduino</strong> <span class="highlight">software</span> and 
                            <span class="highlight">hardware</span> <span class="hover-word small" title="We used the ItsyBitsy microcontroller">components</span>. 
                            We learned how to use different sensors, such as <em>distance sensors</em> and <em>colour sensors</em>, as well as how to <em>control servo motors</em> 
                            for the wheels and bucket system.<br>
                            The final project was putting everything we learned together - this included line following, turning on 
                            intersections, and picking up/dropping items using the bucket and arm system.
                            <br><br>
                            Although the tasks seemed simple at first, there were many challenges that required unique solutions 
                            to make the code function correctly. The main problems were <em>traction</em>, <em>battery life</em>, and using <em>open-loop code</em>. 
                            The first and simplest fix: the traction, which became an issue when the wheels became dirty and started slipping on the ground. 
                            As the wheels became more slippery, the code needed to be <span class="hover-word small" title="Typically for the turns, as it would over/under-steer">slightly adjusted</span> 
                            very often to counteract this, so we cleaned the wheels with a <span class="hover-word small" title="Yes, it works well">toothbrush</span>.<br>
                            The <em>LiPo</em> batteries were hard to work with, since even if a good battery was used, it would be depleted very quickly. The more they 
                            were used, the less power they gave to the <span class="hover-word small" title="Mainly the servo motors">motors and sensors</span>, 
                            which slowed down the bot and changed the timings. Since we were using specific timings for turns, the battery always needed to be fully charged to 
                            be consistent.<br>
                            This leads into the next problem, which is using an open-loop system - This is where everything the bot does 
                            is based on delays without any feedback from any sensors. Clearly, the solution would be to code in a closed-loop system, 
                            where the bots actions are determined based on <span class="hover-word small" title="For example, the bot stops when the range sensor detects a specific distance from an obstacle">sensor readings and feedback</span>. 
                            The challenge with this is that we did not have many sensor options, so we would need to create complex algorithms for some simple actions. 
                            We found a good balance for using open and closed-loop code, and only used open-loop for turns at intersections.                
                            <br><br>
                            As part of the final submission, each group was required to record a short video of the entire run. If

                        The final project in my grade 12 physics class required the students to create a 
                        marble rollercoaster with loops, turns, corkscrews, and more. I chose to design and 3D 
                        print the track and put it all together inside a wooden frame.
                    </p>

                    <div class="box-hidden">
                        <p class="box-description">
                            By the time I began designing the track, I had been learning and practicing with <span class="highlight">CAD</span>, 
                            using software like <strong>OnShape</strong> to create simple models. When the rollercoaster project was assigned, I decided to 
                            3D print the track - unlike other groups who built theirs manually - to both practice and develop more CAD skills.<br>
                            While creating different designs, I encountered problems like the track being <span class="hover-word small" title="The rails would split apart, causing the ball to fall through">too weak</span> or  
                            the rail spacing being <span class="hover-word small" title="Causing either too much friction or making the ball fly off">too wide or too narrow</span>. 
                            After many iterations, the different track parts were measured to have the right balance of strength and stability for the ball. 
                            I created many different types of track segments, such as a <em>straight track</em>, a <em>spiral track</em>, and a <em>hill track</em>:                      
                            <br>

                        For many cars, attaching a front license plate requires either drilling into the front 
                        or using a very expensive bracket. I designed and 3D printed clips that attach 
                        to the front of the car and securely hold the license plate.

                        My first university engineering project was putting together a working water filter. 
                        My team and I designed 3D printed parts and created code to make the filter function properly.

                        my group designed and coded a working 3D printed car with a 360 degree radar, featuring 
                        a working differential drive, steering system, and 360 degree radar.

                        and coding a bot that could drive through a maze, pick up objects, and be able 
                        to detect colours underneath it in order to perform certain tasks.
