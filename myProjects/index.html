                        I began learning coding with Python, which I used to make a bunch of little 
                        games. One of the games is an astrology quiz game, which I used as a science project.

                        After learning the basics of the java programming language in grade 11, 
                        the final project in the course was to create a game using everything that we learned. 
                        I chose to make a recreation of flappy bird with a 2-player feature.

                            My first high school computer science class was all about learning the basics of 
                            <span class="highlight">coding</span>, <span class="highlight">logic</span>, and <span class="highlight">graphics</span> 
                            through <strong>Java</strong>. At the end of the course, each student 
                            created their own game using what we had learned in class. 
                            <br><br>
                            When the game is launched, the user is met with a title screen that gives 3 options - 
                            play the game with one or two players or reading the rules. The single player option works 
                            exactly like the original popular flappy bird game, where the player uses a key to fly a bird through 
                            pipes as long as possible, including the score and even <em>sound effects</em>. <br>
                            The multiplayer was a twist on the game, where two people could play simultaneously and the player 
                            to last the longest was the winner.

                        Throughout my Mechatronics and Robotics Design 1 course, we were 
                        tasked with programming a mini-bot to perform certain tasks. For example, 
                        it needed to be able to follow a line or pick up / drop items 
                        from one location to another.
                    </p>

                    <div class="box-hidden">
                        <p class="box-description">
                            This project spanned 6 weeks, during which each group learned and practiced coding bots 
                            using <strong>Arduino</strong> <span class="highlight">software</span> and 
                            <span class="highlight">hardware</span> <span class="hover-word small" title="We used the ItsyBitsy microcontroller">components</span>. 
                            We learned how to use different sensors, such as <em>distance sensors</em>, <em>colour sensors</em>, and <em>controlling servo motors</em> 
                            for the wheels and bucket system.<br>
                            The final project was putting everything we learned together - this included line following, turning on 
                            intersections, and picking up / dropping items using the bucket and arm system.
                            <br><br>
                            Although the tasks seemed simple at first, there were many challenges that required unique solutions 
                            to make the code function correctly. The main problems were <em>traction</em>, <em>battery life</em>, and using <em>open loop code</em>. 
                            The first and simplest fix: the traction, which went wrong when the wheels became dirty and started slipping on the ground. 
                            As the wheels became more slippery, the code needed to be <span class="hover-word small" title="Typicaly for the turns, as it would over or under-steer">slightly adjusted</span> 
                            very often to counteract this, so we cleaned the wheels with a <span class="hover-word small" title="Yes, it works well">toothbrush</span>.<br>
                            The <em>LiPo</em> batteries were hard to work with, since even if a good battery was used, it would be depleted very quickly. The more they 
                            were used, the less power they gave to the <span class="hover-word small" title="Mainly the servo motors">motors and sensors</span>, 
                            which slowed down the bot and changed the timings. Since we were using specific timings for turns, the battery needed to always be charged to 
                            be consistent.<br>
                            This leads into the next problem, which is using an open loop system - this is where everything the bot does 
                            is based on delays without any feedback from any sensors. Clearly, the solution would be to code in a closed loop system, 
                            where the bots actions are determined based on <span class="hover-word small" title="For example, the bot stops when the range sensor detects a specific distance from an obstacle">sensor readings and feeback</span>. 
                            The challenge with this is that we did not have many options for sensors, so we would need to create complex algorithms for some simple actions. 
                            We found a good balance for using open and closed loop code, and only used open loop for turns at intersections.                
                            <br><br>
                            As part of the final submission, each group was required to record a short video of the entire run. If

                        The final project for my grade 12 Computer Engineering class - a small 3D printed mini mac 
                        computer with an LED matrix screen that displays different images for each click. It also includeds
                        a keyboard with lights (and even plays music).

                        My first university engineering project was putting together a working water filter. 
                        My team and I designed 3D printed parts and created code to make the filter function properly.

                        As the final project for my data structures and algorithms course in first year, 
                        my group designed and coded a working 3D printed car with a 360 degree radar, featuring 
                        a working differential drive, steering system, and 360 degree radar.

                        During the 2025 UTRA Hackathon at UofT, we were tasked with putting together 
                        and coding a bot that could drive through a maze, pick up objects, and be able 
                        to detect colours underneath it in order to perform certain tasks.
