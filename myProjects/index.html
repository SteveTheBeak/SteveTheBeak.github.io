                        the final project in the course was to create a game using everything that we learned. 
                        I chose to make a recreation of flappy bird with a 2-player feature.

                            My first high school computer science class was all about learning the basics of 
                            <span class="highlight">coding</span>, <span class="highlight">logic</span>, and <span class="highlight">graphics</span> 
                            through <strong>Java</strong>. At the end of the course, each student 
                            created their own game using what we had learned in class.

                            When the game is launched, the user is met with a title screen that gives 3 options â€” 
                            play the game with one or two players or read the rules. The single-player option works 
                            exactly like the original popular Flappy bird game, where the player uses a key to fly a bird through 
                            pipes as long as possible, including the score and even <em>sound effects</em>. <br>
                            The multi-player is a twist on the game, where two people could play simultaneously and the player 
                            who lasts the longest is the winner.

                        Throughout my Mechatronics and Robotics Design 1 course, we were 
                        tasked with programming a mini-bot to perform certain tasks. For example, 
                        it needed to be able to follow a line or pick up / drop items 
                        from one location to another.

                    <div class="box-hidden">
                        <p class="box-description">
                            This project spanned 6 weeks, during which each group learned and practiced coding bots 
                            using <strong>Arduino</strong> <span class="highlight">software</span> and 
                            <span class="highlight">hardware</span> <span class="hover-word small" title="We used the ItsyBitsy microcontroller">components</span>. 
                            We learned how to use different sensors, such as <em>distance sensors</em> and <em>colour sensors</em>, as well as how to <em>control servo motors</em> 
                            for the wheels and bucket system.<br>
                            The final project was putting everything we learned together â€” this included line following, turning on 
                            intersections, and picking up/dropping items using the bucket and arm system.
                            <br><br>
                            Although the tasks seemed simple at first, there were many challenges that required unique solutions 
                            to make the code function correctly. The main problems were <em>traction</em>, <em>battery life</em>, and using <em>open-loop code</em>. 
                            The first and simplest fix: the traction, which became an issue when the wheels became dirty and started slipping on the ground. 
                            As the wheels became more slippery, the code needed to be <span class="hover-word small" title="Typically for the turns, as it would over/under-steer">slightly adjusted</span> 
                            very often to counteract this, so we cleaned the wheels with a <span class="hover-word small" title="Yes, it works well">toothbrush</span>.<br>
                            The <em>LiPo</em> batteries were hard to work with, since even if a good battery was used, it would be depleted very quickly. The more they 
                            were used, the less power they gave to the <span class="hover-word small" title="Mainly the servo motors">motors and sensors</span>, 
                            which slowed down the bot and changed the timings. Since we were using specific timings for turns, the battery always needed to be fully charged to 
                            be consistent.<br>
                            This leads into the next problem, which is using an open-loop system â€” This is where everything the bot does 
                            is based on delays without any feedback from any sensors. Clearly, the solution would be to code in a closed-loop system, 
                            where the bots actions are determined based on <span class="hover-word small" title="For example, the bot stops when the range sensor detects a specific distance from an obstacle">sensor readings and feedback</span>. 
                            The challenge with this is that we did not have many sensor options, so we would need to create complex algorithms for some simple actions. 
                            We found a good balance for using open and closed-loop code, and only used open-loop for turns at intersections.                
                            <br><br>
                            As part of the final submission, each group was required to record a short video of the entire run. If

                        The final project in my grade 12 physics class required the students to create a 
                        marble rollercoaster with loops, turns, corkscrews, and more. I chose to design and 3D 
                        print the track and put it all together inside a wooden frame.
                    </p>

                        <p class="box-description">
                            By the time I began designing the track, I had been learning and practicing with <span class="highlight">CAD</span>, 
                            using software like <strong>OnShape</strong> to create simple models. When the rollercoaster project was assigned, I decided to 
                            3D-print the track â€” unlike other groups who built theirs manually â€” to both practice and develop more CAD skills.<br>
                            While creating different designs, I encountered problems like the track being <span class="hover-word small" title="The rails would split apart, causing the ball to fall through">too weak</span> or  
                            the rail spacing being <span class="hover-word small" title="Causing either too much friction or making the ball fly off">too wide or too narrow</span>. 
                            After many iterations, the different track parts were measured to have the right balance of strength and stability for the ball. 
                            I created many different types of track segments, such as a <em>straight track</em>, a <em>spiral track</em>, and a <em>hill track</em>:

                            consists of two pairs of clips that are attached at two points on the bumper. One clip hooks onto and under the bumper, 
                            and the other part clips onto the top. The license plate is then screwed on, attached to the two parts, and simultaneously

                            After learning more advanced <strong>Arduino</strong> electronics and code, each student was tasked with building a model of a Mac computer. 
                            We were given a 3D-printed casing, in which all the electronics were placed, along with all the materials we needed to use. The Mac consists of 
                            an 8x8 LED matrix, a button, an LED strip, and other parts. When the button is pressed, the screen changes and cycles through different designs.

                            before looping back to the start. The Mac also has a keyboard attached to it with an LED strip inside, giving it working lights that can change colour. 
                            While the melody plays, the keyboard begins displaying rainbow lights.

                            libraries. For the music, each note in the melody is assigned a specific value and stored in an array, which is then played with specific durations and timed delays, 
                            producing different beat lengths and forming the full melody.

                            This project was designed as an introduction to the engineering process. Each team held weekly 
                            meetings to <em>determine and analyze data</em>, <em>create designs</em>, and <em>document progress</em> through 
                            reports. It taught teamwork/collaboration and problem solving â€” skills that are needed for creating a functional

                            The purpose of the project was to create a working prototype of a water filter. Using centrifugal and peristaltic pumps to move 
                            the water, <span class="hover-word small" title="Turbidity is the measure of how many particles are found in water â€” a higher turbidity means the water is dirtier">turbidity</span>

                            the filter uses aluminum sulfate (alum) powder to clump soil and dirt found in the water together, which is then transferred through a syringe packed with layers of 
                            <span class="hover-word small" title="Like fine sand, or a sponge">filtering materials</span> that blocks any remaining particles, leaving only <span class="hover-word small" title="I still wouldn't recommend drinking it though">

                            <br><br>
                            To begin the project, we were given a hypothetical scenario in which a community needed a drinking water system. We were given multiple options,                           
                            each having its own advantages and drawbacks, and we needed to choose the most appropriate one based on specific criteria. 
                            After figuring out all the logistics and constraints, we began designing the main water filter system. While all the necessary materials were provided, 
                            many parts still had to be designed and implemented by our team. For example, we had to calculate <em>motor torque</em>, design a <em>powder dispensing system</em>, 
                            assemble all the parts into a <em>functional prototype</em>, and write code for the entire system to filter the water properly.<br>
                            The team used <strong>SOLIDWORKS</strong> to create <span class="highlight">CAD models</span> and <strong>Arduino software</strong> to write <span class="highlight">code</span> for the electronics. 
                            After many tests and improvements, the final prototype filter worked correctly.

                    <p>
                        As the final project for my data structures and algorithms course in first year, 
                        my group designed and coded a working 3D-printed car with a 360 degree radar, featuring 
                        a working differential drive, steering system, and 360 degree radar.
                    </p>

                    <div class="box-hidden">
                        <p class="box-description">
                            The idea for a functional 3D-printed car model first came from inspiration from the way real cars work. At first, I found a 3D model 
                            of a differential gear system (<a class="link" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11836" target="_blank">click here</a> to view the 3D model on Thingiverse), and designed a frame 
                            with the differential system implemented in it. After making some adjustments, I added a <em>motor</em> with a gear reduction to power the differential system with more torque, 
                            and <em>wheels</em> to the custom axles.
                            <br><br>
                            Now, even though the car was able to drive, it needed a steering system. To continue making the car as realistic as possible, 
                            I designed a steering system that works very similarly to one found in real cars. A <em>180-degree servo motor</em> was used to power the steering â€” the servo  
                            is connected to a rack and pinion, which transfers rotational to linear motion. The rack is then connected to rods called arms, with ball joints (tie rods) for full range of motion. 
                            The arms are then connected to the front wheels, allowing them to rotate and turn. To view the inspiration for this design, <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em1O8mz7sF0&t=2m54s" target="_blank">click here</a> 
                            to view the YouTube video describing how car steering works.<br>
                            Finally, after all the designs were finalized, they were assembled on a frame, creating a working drive system for the car.
                            <br><br>
                            <img class="img-description zoom" src="../images/178Project/178CarBelly.jpg" alt="Underside of 3D-printed car model" style="width: 400px" title="Press and hold to enlarge">
                            <br><br>
                            After designing the main car, we needed to somehow implement a radar with a 360-degree turning radius. We only had 180-degree servo motors, 
                            so I designed a 2:1 gear ratio that allowed the <strong>ultrasonic sensor</strong> to rotate in every direction.<br>
                            For the electronics, I used an <span class="hover-word small" title="An H-bridge is used to reverse the polarity of an applied voltage, such as in a DC motor">H-bridge motor driver</span> 
                            to allow reverse driving, and a <span class="hover-word small" title="A transistor controls the flow of current â€” useful for a car using a DC motor">transistor</span> for speed control. 
                            Along with steering, a servo motor was used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor, all of which were controlled by an <strong>Arduino UNO</strong> microcontroller.
                            <br><br>
                            After the project was finished, I wanted to improve the design â€” I added a motor driver to supply more current to the motor, powered by a larger battery setup. I also tried adding more 
                            motors to the drive system, but too much friction was a major issue. Even with many other possible improvements, this project gave me the opportunity to 
                            practice and develop my <strong>CAD</strong> and <strong>electronics</strong> skills.

                        and coding a bot that could drive through a maze, pick up objects, and be able 
                        to detect colours underneath it in order to perform certain tasks.

                            My very first hackathon â€” where each team gets two days to scramble and build a bot as quickly as possible that manages 
                            to perform certain tasks. The objectives for that event were to <em>navigate through a maze</em>, drive to the center of a target using 
                            <em>colour detection</em>, and <em>navigate/place a flag</em> in a specific location.
                            <br><br>
                            To start off, my group was given a set of 3D-printed parts and electronics to use throughout the event. We began assembling the main body, 
                            which we needed to figure out as quickly as possible to leave time for programming. At first, with a few setbacks, we managed to get the driving working, 
                            which used two motors controlling each front wheel. While starting some code for the colour sensor, we began working on putting together the arm, 
                            which would <em>grab items</em> and hold the <em>ultrasonic sensor</em>.
                            <br><br>
                            With a tight time frame to build and code the bot, we were rushed to finish on time, which led to many difficulties. At first, 
                            we needed to figure out how to put together all the hardware, which ultimately required a lot of glue and attempts. However, after finishing the main frame 
                            and drive system for the bot, wiring all the electronics to the <strong>Arduino</strong> was much easier and quicker. Once most of the electronics were connected, 
                            we needed to write code to make the bot perform all the tasks correctly, which was the most tedious task. Initially, we needed to learn about code implementation 
                            for each sensor, since most of them were new to us. Then, plenty of testing was required since code is not the easiest to get working. In the end, we were not able 
                            to get the bot working for every challenge, and it didn't even work well for the one we focused on, but participating in the hackathon prepared us for 
                            future hackathons and figuring out how to use different electronics in general.<br>
                            We named our bot "Robotic Anxiety" because of its visual resemblance to the character "Anxiety" from <em>Inside Out</em>, and because of all the anxiety our team went through 
                            during the event. You can <a class="link" href="https://devpost.com/software/robotic-anxiety" target="_blank">click here</a> to visit the Devpost page about our bot.
